## Write-up

### JavaScript Challenges

The timer logic was written by vanilla JavaScript API.
Only use Vite as development tool.

Used concepts:

* Classes
* Enclosure

Used API:

* querySelector
* addEventListener
* classList.toggle
* toggleAttribute

Used syntax sugar:

* Optional chaining
* Nullish coalescing

The implementation could be further improves such as write a stand alone *raf* utility class.

### CSS Challenges 

Used CSS skills:

* Variables and Calculation
* Grid layout
* Circle border and shadow
* Using SVG to draw a circle

It's not easy for me, I have to follow the solution to create the CSS.
